I like to use my boxes remotely,
link to ssh -x and stuff,

explain tor is justg a firewalled way.

All cool if you want to acces one of your services, but imagine, your phone or you laptop, on any wifi network, not just the one you configured, or you have to nmap to find the ip, or hope that the network support my localname... have a proper configured mdns

1.Install tor

2.Monitor with arm to make sure it does not uses bandwidth (battery and bandwidht for ex. gsm)

3. bis step, think about running a tor relay or even a exit node on a server at home, this is imperative to working, you use it, give back, relay nodes do not require .... bridges are really usefull if you do not it as a web service

change torrc with monitoring arm
and to hidden service,
