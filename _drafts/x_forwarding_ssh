Sometimes, I want to access a program on a remot
There are 2 reasons why you'd want to do this; Number one is security en number 2 is just ease.
The security standpoint is obvious, accessing a GUI application on e remote host in a secure way (as opposed to vnc) with a ssh protocol you are already using.

And, Vnc will have to launch or forward a complete desktop session, there are ways to go around this but still, even if you wanted to access a box behind a firewall, you'd have to set up multiple hops of port forwarding with for example (#TODO link to article) ssh.

So I needed to do this (#link article KVM) for remote managing my virtualization cluster, programs like virt-manager, which provide libvirt ( a way of managing KVM and other virtualization techniques ) with a
virtual interface.
Virt-manager has a way to connect over SSH and even SSL, but this would have access to my virtual machines, so I'd like to keep them more secured. read here (#TODO article) how I try to keep my machines only remote accessible trough 1 manner only, namely ssh.
Tldr; If I keep SSH updated and rotate the keys, all is safe.

Requirements
- Remote device you want to access (Linux, Windows, MacOSX) -> from now on called 'server'
- Client device which you want to connect with, running a X enviroment -> from now on called 'client'

To have it X forward,

You can have multiple sessions or multiple encryption steps between you and the machine, but al have to be started with -X in ssh

and 2 configuration options have to be active in all the sshd_config files between you and the server you are trying to get something from

## cut
install xorg-xauth and xorg-xhost from the official repositories

sudo pacman -Sy xorg-xauth xorg-xhost
On every machine you are x forwarding from

in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
verify that AllowTcpForwarding and X11UseLocalhost options are set to yes, and that X11DisplayOffset is set to 10 (those are the default values if nothing has been changed, see sshd_config(5))
set X11Forwarding to yes
then restart the sshd daemon.

I ran into a bug,
just change AdressFamily to inet

AddressFamily inet
in that same file and it will work
##



Then log into all your machines with the -X option in a string and run in the last session like if you were goingto start a GUI application

### if you have problems try -Y or X11localhost to no (I needed this when I forwarded twice):
