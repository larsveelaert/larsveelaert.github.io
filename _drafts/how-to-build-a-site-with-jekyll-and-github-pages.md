I've made websites with Content Management Systems (CMS) before. But sometimes, especially if the person who will manage the site is technical, this can be overkill. Too much graphical interface, too much nonsense to get over, and sometimes just to much optimalization needed to get a fast, responsive website. 
If you just want somthing simple this can all be a bit of overkill. But what is the alternative? Designing or editing static HTML-files is a pain. 

search a theme


check the quickstart for the needed gems, you defnitly also need jeckyll and bundler
sometimes the repositroy includes a Gemfile (check, with in it all the dependencies)
Bundle install will complete it
good idea to make gthe gemfile, if you ever need to change it

bundle exec jekyll serve

#whiteglass is
get gem (from ruby)
gem install bundler jekyll
create own and then  clone both theme and own
change url and baseurl to right ones
copy the contents to own
bundle exec jekyll serve
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch (for editingblog)
